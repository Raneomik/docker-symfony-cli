# docker-symfony-cli
##  Minimalist version (75Mb)

Generic php-alpine docker image embedding [symfony binary tool](https://symfony.com/download), openssh-client, rsync, pcov (only, not xDebug) for test coverage...

It's inspired by [edbizarro gitlib-ci image](https://github.com/edbizarro/gitlab-ci-pipeline-php), 
and is aimed for (as lightweight as possible) CI/CD php/symfony applications.

Required php extensions comes by need (issues / PRs are welcome).
