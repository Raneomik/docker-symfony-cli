# docker-symfony-cli
docker image embedding [symfony binary tool](https://symfony.com/download).

It's based on [edbizarro gitlib-ci image](https://github.com/edbizarro/gitlab-ci-pipeline-php), 
and is also mainly for CI php/symfony applications/ testing tools.

The symfony bin also comes with a [full-featured local web-dev server](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html).
